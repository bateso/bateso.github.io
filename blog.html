            We have had a very busy, busy week! We have had over 500 donuts sold! I am so thankful for everyone coming out to support us. We made over $300 to give to Meals On Wheels and Kids Power Packs. I have been so busy planning our next event to host and that will come out on our news letter that you can sign up for at the bottom of our about us page. I am so appreciative of the bakers and all my staff that have been working so hard to bring you the best quality donuts. Our store hours are from 6am to 4pm Monday-Friday and 7am to 6pm on Saturdays and Closed Sundays. Hope you guys can swing by anytime to buy a donut and support our charity partners! </p>

            <span class="lorem-ipsum text-info">THIS IS WRITTEN BY OLIVIA ON MARCH 20, 2019:</span> <p class="Blog-Text">I just got back from my vacation to Rwanda. I went to Rwanda to support a mission called Compassion International. Compassion International is a mission where children from impoverished countries are supported by people who are more fortunate then themselves. The people sponsoring their compassion child pay for all the child's medical needs and an education through 12th grade. I was partnering with them for this trip and it was so much fun! I loved getting to know all the children and parents through this great mission. I am going to be putting up pieces of papers with children's pictures and a little bit about them on a bulletin board at the Amazin' Glazin' store so you can sponsor a child yourself. All you have to do is grab the child's picture that you want to sponsor and show it to the front counter. Then you will receive a letter in the mail telling you what all it means to support a child. So come down to Amazin' Glazin' and come support a Compassion Child for yourself!</p>

              Hey listen, Lorraine. There's that dance at school tonight. Right now, my car's all fixed. I'd figured that I'd cut you a break and give you the honour of going with the best-looking guy in school. Well, I'm busy tonight, Biff. Doing what? Washing my hair. That's as funny as a screen door on a battleship.May I help you inside with these? Oh no, that won't be necessary. You've done more than enough already. But it's really no trouble. Doc, she says it's fine, and we gotta get goin'. (to Clara) Ma'am, good luck with the school teachin' and everything. Clara, I'll straighten everything out with Mr. Statler from the buckboard rental ... don't you worry about that. I feel someone's responsible for what happened.Marty, that dream I had was so real. It was about the future. It was about us...and you got fired. What do you mean, I got </p>

              Jesus. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. (A few minutes later both Doc and Marty are fully clothed in radiation suits. Doc injects a rod of plutonium into the Delorean, then removes his helmet.) Safe now, everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. (goes to climb in the Delorean) Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. The future, it's where you're going?Here. There! (points) (Marty puts the hoverboard down, and of course it hovers. He looks at it, and then jumps on, hovering past the Café 80's.) He's got a hoverboard! Get the boards!That's him. (Marty points out George who's walking down the hall. He has a 'kick me' sign on his back and guys keep going by and kicking him in  </p>

All right, so that's why you've gotta come back with me. (confused) Where?Yes it's me, Marty. Are you alright? I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just that you're so, you're so big.
