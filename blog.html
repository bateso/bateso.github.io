              Ha, ha, ha, yeah! Manure! I hate manure! (Lyon Estates) (The DeLorean flies to the billboard, and Marty lets go of the flag ribbon. He takes his foot off the hoverboard and speaks to Doc over the walkie-talkies.the lightning storm is starting.) (w.t) Doc, is everything all right, over?(Mason Street) (Marty is in view, wearing a leather coat, glasses and a hat. Very not inconspicuous. From this point on when Marty and Doc talk, they are on their walkie-talkies (w.t).) (w.t) Doc, come in Doc, this is Marty, over. (v.o) Roger Marty, this is Doc. Are you there? (Marty looks through the binoculars. He's looking at a house, filled with garden ornaments and a sign - No Trespassers - Violators Will Be Prosecuted. This Means You!)(Doc leaves the garage.) Marty, Marty? Damn! (He tears the price tag off his hat.) Where is that kid? (Biffy’s Car) (He's driving to the dance. A tunnel lies ahead. Marty gets the walkie-talkie.) (w.t) Doc, Doc, come in!(Instead of living in his small workshop, Doc now lives in a very large house. Marty knocks on the door. As he turns his back, waiting for Doc to answer the door, the door opens a crack and Doc peaks out. When Marty turns Doc slams the door shut.) Doc? (Doc opens the door fully now. He's got some strange contraption on his head. He pulls Marty into the living room.) Don't say a word. Doc. </p>

               Lights on? (The lights come on.) Yes, now look. Just take it easy and you'll be fine. And be careful in the future. Future? Have a nice day Mrs McFly.I'm going with Calvin Klein, OK? Calvin Klein? (He grabs Lorraine by her shoulders and turns her to face him.) No, that's not OK. You're going with me, understand? Get your cooties off of me! When are you going to get it through that thick skull of yours Lorraine, you're my girl! Biff Tannen, I wouldn't be your girl even if... (pause) even if you had a million dollars! (She kicks Biff in the leg.)These are our boys! (Two young boys step into sight.) Jules, and Verne! Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer. Doc, I thought I'd never see you again! Can't keep a good scientist down. After all, I had to come back for Einstein, and I didn't want you to be worried about me. (Clara hands him something wrapped in brown paper.) Oh. I brought you a little souvenir. (Doc stoops down from the train but doesn't get off, and gives the gift to Marty. Marty rips it open. Inside is a framed photo of him and Doc at the clock tower in 1885.) It's great Doc. Thanks!</p>

              No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. (They all climb into the car. And Doc backs up into the street.) Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. (Doc pulls his sunglasses down and hits a button. Suddenly the car is airborne. They take off into the future.)(Biff pushes Lorraine and she falls to the floor. Marty tries to run towards Biff.) You son of a bitch! 3-Hey! (Match and Skinhead hold Marty back. Lorraine lets out a cry of pain. Biff walks over to Marty.) Always the little hothead, huh? You wanna take a poke at me?Well, well, well, Mr Tannen. How nice to see you here. Why Mr Strickland, it's nice to see you sir. Is that liquor I smell, Tannen? Uh, I wouldn't know, I don't know what liquor smells like 'coz I'm too young to drink it. I see. And what have we here? Sports statistics, interesting subject. Homework, Tannen? </p>

              Hey listen, Lorraine. There's that dance at school tonight. Right now, my car's all fixed. I'd figured that I'd cut you a break and give you the honour of going with the best-looking guy in school. Well, I'm busy tonight, Biff. Doing what? Washing my hair. That's as funny as a screen door on a battleship.May I help you inside with these? Oh no, that won't be necessary. You've done more than enough already. But it's really no trouble. Doc, she says it's fine, and we gotta get goin'. (to Clara) Ma'am, good luck with the school teachin' and everything. Clara, I'll straighten everything out with Mr. Statler from the buckboard rental ... don't you worry about that. I feel someone's responsible for what happened.Marty, that dream I had was so real. It was about the future. It was about us...and you got fired. What do you mean, I got fired? (He notices the sign outside the car on Jennifer's side.) Hilldale. Hilldale! This is where we live...I...I mean, this is, uh, this is where we're gonna live. Someday. (He smiles sheepishly.) (giving Marty a strange look) Marty...it was a dream, wasn't it? (Before Marty gets a chance to reply, there is a sound of tires screeching and another truck pulls up next to them. It's Needles and his gang. Inside the truck, the song "The Power of Love" by Huey Lewis and the News is booming.) Hey! The big "M". How's it hanging, McFly? </p>

              Jesus. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. (A few minutes later both Doc and Marty are fully clothed in radiation suits. Doc injects a rod of plutonium into the Delorean, then removes his helmet.) Safe now, everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. (goes to climb in the Delorean) Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. The future, it's where you're going?Here. There! (points) (Marty puts the hoverboard down, and of course it hovers. He looks at it, and then jumps on, hovering past the Café 80's.) He's got a hoverboard! Get the boards!That's him. (Marty points out George who's walking down the hall. He has a 'kick me' sign on his back and guys keep going by and kicking him in the butt.) Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Maybe you were adopted. Okay, real mature guys. (He drops his books.) Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books?Lorenzo, where're you keys? The keys are in the trunk. Say that again. I said the keys are in here. (Parking Lot) </p>

              (The old man laughs as Marty runs into the Saloon.) Doc! Doc! (He sees the glass.) What're you doin'? I lost her, Marty. There's nothing left of me here. All right, so that's why you've gotta come back with me. (confused) Where?Yes it's me, Marty. Are you alright? I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just that you're so, you're so big. Everything's going to be fine, Marty. Are you hungry? I can call room service. Room service? (o.s) Lorraine!Bartender...I'm looking for that no good cheatin' blacksmith. You seen him? Scared. No, sir, Mr. Tannen, I have not. Tannen. You're Mad Dog Tannen. Tannen (formerly Gang Leader)Mad Dog? (Everyone in the saloon runs and hides, but Marty stays where he is.) I hate that name. I hate it, you hear? Nobody calls me Mad Dog. 'Specially not some, duded-up, egg sucking, gutter trash. (He points a gun at Marty's feet and shoots, causing Marty to jump to save his feet.) AHH!(slowly spits out two mouthfuls of manure) I hate manure. (to Marty) Look! (He indicates the split tombstone and Marty immediately whips out the photo, from which the image of the tombstone vanishes.) YES! (In the distance the train whistle blows.)</p>
